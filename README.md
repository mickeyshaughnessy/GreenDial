# GreenDial
GreenDial is an open platform for personal health data, specifically my personal health.

You are welcome to use this software and contribute to this repository. If you'd like to use my interface, please contact me to ask for access.

Please don't maliciously interact with this system.
I am providing the software and the platform free of charge and paying for API calls out of my own pocket.

The core functionality is a concierge chatbot, Dr. Heath.

Dr. Heath connects LLM APIs to transform unstructured user input into records, autonomously engage in conversation with people about their health, and activate external services on behalf of the user.

External services include:
* An authentication service
* Long-term memory service
* Personalization (aka settings)
* Reminders
* Suggestions
* Data analysis
* Freeform LLM chat

The platform is designed with services, with the LLM Dr. Heath chatbot at the center, mediating service calls and handling user input and output.
