## Using
You are welcome to use this software and contribute to this repository.

## Description
The core functionality is a concierge chatbot, Doc.

You can access it here: [GreenDial](https://www.greendial.org) 

My primary personal use of greendial is to have a way to:
* store data about my diet, activity, health, etc.
* set up goals and reminders

I am trying to make it flexible enough to help with a variety of other things, including
* pair programming,
* lists,
* building digital assistants

Doc connects LLM APIs to transform unstructured user input into records, autonomously engage in conversation with people about their health, and activate external services on behalf of the person.

External services include:
* An authentication service
* Long-term memory service
* Personalization (aka settings)
* Reminders / Goals
* Suggestions
* Data analysis
* Freeform LLM chat
